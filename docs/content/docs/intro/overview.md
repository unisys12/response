## What is Response?

Response is an open source product designed to enable both realistic and lore-friendly role-playing environments in-game.
Features in Response are similar to the real-world counterparts of Computer Aided Dispatching (CAD) software,
Mobile Data Terminals (MDT), and Records Management Systems (RMS).

## People

Response itself is an extension of your role-play environment and your characters are a first-class citizen. In
Response, you create `People` to reflect characters you role-play as, in any capacity, within your community.

### Acting As

In Response, you'll always act as a `Person`. If you need to switch the person you're acting as, click the silhouette
icon in the upper right-hand corner of Response and then select either an existing or new person form the flyout.

When switching people, the actions available to you in Response will change dynamically to reflect the abilities that the
newly selected person has. For example, a person who is a normal civilian will see different features than a person who
exists within a law enforcement agency. Similarly, an on-duty officer will have different features than an off-duty
officer.

### Attributes & Data Points

Once a person is created some attributes may not be changed.

As an example, a `Person`'s race or ethnicity is immutable. Once set, you may not change this attribute. Unlike a
person's race, attributes like their hair color, height, or weight, may be modified freely.

Data points such as warrants or citations make up a person's criminal history and may only be changed through standard
processes. As an example, you may not remove warrants issued for your person.

### Interaction Locks

When a person you're acting as is engaged with emergency services you will be unable to make changes to the person's
record. This is known as an interaction lock and may be enabled or disabled by your Response administrator.
